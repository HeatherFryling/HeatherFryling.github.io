			  <h2>Bees are Important</h2> <div id="ok">
                <div id="box2"><p>As the world’s population continues to grow, the importance of pollinators to crop production cannot be underestimated. One in every three things that we eat requires a pollinator to reproduce. According to <a href="https://www.greenpeace.org/usa/sustainable-agriculture/save-the-bees/ ">Greenpeace</a>, “seventy out of the top 100 human food crops — which supply about 90 percent of the world’s nutrition — are pollinated by bees.” 
                                <br/>
                                <br/>Honey bees are not native and were brought to North America from Europe by colonists, with honey bees only arriving on the West Coast in the 1860’s. As a result, native bees play a critical role in crop pollination. 
                                <br/>
                                <br/>Unlike honey bees, most bees native to the Pacific Northwest are solitary. Solitary bees will excavate holes in the ground or make their homes in hollow stems. Because they are not protecting a group or territory this means that native bees are much less likely to sting.</p>

		<h2>Causes of Bee Population Decline</h2>
        <p>There are many factors that have contributed to the decline of both native and domestic honeybee populations. Various studies have shown that bees are affected by pesticides, air pollution, habitat loss, climate change, drought, and disease although many scientists believe that habitat loss and pesticides and the primary cause for the widespread decline.
                <br/>
                <br/>Many native bees only pollinate a single species or group of plants. They also tend to spend more time at each flower allowing them to gather more pollen to pollinate a greater number of plants per stop.
                <br/>
                <br/><a href="https://www.arboretumfoundation.org/about-us/publications/bulletin/bulletin-archive/pacific-northwest-bees/ ">Research has shown</a> that as native plants are removed to expand cropland and build new housing developments, many native bee populations are declining or disappearing completely.</p>

            <br/>A 2017 study published in <a href="https://www.biologicaldiversity.org/campaigns/native_pollinators/pdfs/Pollinators_in_Peril.pdf">Center for Biological Diversity</a> found that of the 1,437 native bee species native to North America and Hawaii, 749 are declining.

	<h2>Bees Native to the Pacific Northwest</h2>
                <h3>Bumble Bees</h3>	
				<p>As pollination generalists with longer active seasons and wide distribution ranges, bumble bees are very important. Bumble bees are buzz pollinators, meaning they vibrate a flower at a frequency that causes additional pollen to be released. Some plants, such as tomatoes, require a buzz pollinator for pollination to be successful. Due to their unique characteristics, bumble bees are considered keystone species since numerous plants in a variety of ecosystems rely on them for their own survival.</p>
				<h3>Mason Bees</h3>
                    <p>Mason bees require mud to build their nests in naturally occurring above-ground openings. They pollinate a wide variety of plants and are sold for pollination purposes. Due to their reliance on mud they are vulnerable to drought conditions.</p>
                    <h3>Sweat Bees</h3>
                    <p>Sweat bees are sometimes confused with flies due to their small size and habit of collecting salt from animal sweat (including humans). Due to their size they are good pollinators for deep flowers where the nectar and pollen may be inaccessible to their larger counterparts. They are one of the most common bees in urban and agricultural environments.</p>
                    <h3>Mining Bees</h3>
                    <p>Mining bees can often be found nesting in the ground at the base of blueberry plants and other than bumble bees are one of their primary pollinators. Mining bees will also commonly build nests in lawns.</p>
                    <h3>Leafcutter Bees</h3>
                    <p>Leafcutter bees, as their name implies, use their large mandibles to cut sections of leaves and petals to build their nests above ground in holes in wood. While leafcutter bees cause superficial damage to the plants they visit, they are also very productive summer pollinators.</p>
                    <h3>Cuckoo Bees</h3>
                    <p>Similar to cuckoo birds laying their eggs in the nests of other birds, cuckoo bees prefer other bees to do the work of nest building and also lay their eggs in the nests of other bees. Upon hatching, cuckoo bee larvae search out and destroy their non-cuckoo bee nest companions. Cuckoo bees tend to decline when the population of their host species declines.</p>
